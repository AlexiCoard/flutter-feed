# flutter_feed

Flutter feed generator - A bunch of widgets to build feeds


## TODO

 - Do we keep the abstract feed interface ?
 - Make Twitter feed better (include retweets count, ~~open tweet in nav~~)
 - Load credentials from file (inject in constructor ?)
 - More feeds : Medium, other ?
 - ~~Make some real widget~~
 - Maybe a package containing all feeds and a generic class to extends ?
